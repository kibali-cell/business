## System Architecture

The application follows a **modular, service-oriented architecture** for flexibility and maintainability:

- **Database:** Managed via Laravel migrations for schema consistency.  
- **Models:** Represent core entities (e.g., `Invoice`, `Product`, `Budget`).  
- **Controllers:** Handle requests, validation, and responses.  
- **Services:** Abstract complex logic (e.g., `CurrencyConversionService`, `BankIntegrationService`).  
- **Views:** Responsive Blade templates with Bootstrap 5 and modal-based CRUD operations.  
- **Routes:** RESTful, prefixed for clarity (e.g., `/finance/`, `/inventory/`).
