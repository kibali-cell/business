## Overview

Business Management Software is designed to help businesses manage operations, finances, inventory, and more through an integrated system. The application is built using Laravel 11, PHP 8.2+, and modern front-end technologies like Bootstrap 5 and Chart.js for a responsive, user-friendly experience.

## Features

- **CRM & Dashboard:** Multi-role support (Admin, Manager, Employee), real-time notifications, and interactive dashboards.
- **Financial Management:**
  - **Invoices & Multi-Currency Support:** Create invoices in various currencies, with conversion to a base currency for unified reporting.
  - **Bank Account Integration:** Manually or automatically sync bank transactions from external sources.
  - **Budget Planning & Monitoring:** Track budgets with allocated vs. actual spending, automatic variance calculation, and modal-based CRUD operations.
- **Inventory Management:**
  - **Product Management:** Manage products with details including SKU, barcode, price, cost, quantity, reorder point, and status.
  - **Inventory Transactions:** Track stock in/out, record transactions (with multi-warehouse support), and update product quantities in real time.
  - **Purchase Orders & Suppliers:** Create and manage purchase orders and supplier details.
  - **Additional Features:** Barcode/QR integration, low-stock alerts, and inventory valuation reports.
- **Other Modules:** HR, Project Management, and Business Intelligence are planned for future phases.

---

## Architecture

The application is built with a modular architecture, separating concerns into:

- **Migrations:** Define and update the database schema.
- **Models:** Represent database entities (Invoice, Expense, Product, etc.).
- **Controllers:** Handle request validation, business logic, and responses.
- **Services:** Encapsulate external integrations and complex business logic (e.g., `CurrencyConversionService`, `BankIntegrationService`).
- **Views:** Blade templates built with Bootstrap 5 for a modern, responsive UI. Many CRUD operations are handled via modals for seamless user interaction.
- **Routes:** Organized in groups with clear prefixes (e.g., `/finance/invoices`, `/finance/bank-transactions`, `/finance/budgets`, `/inventory`) for maintainability.

## Financial Modules

### Invoices & Multi-Currency Support

- **Database:**  
  Invoices table includes a `currency` field to store a 3-letter currency code (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP).
- **Functionality:**  
  Users create invoices, selecting the appropriate currency. A dedicated conversion service converts invoice totals to a base currency (e.g., USD) for reporting.
- **Reporting:**  
  The dashboard aggregates revenue, outstanding receivables, and profit, converting each invoice’s total to the base currency for consistency.

### Bank Account Integration

- **Database:**  
  A `bank_transactions` table stores transactions from external bank APIs, including fields for `transaction_date`, `amount`, `description`, and `external_reference`.
- **Functionality:**  
  A `BankIntegrationService` simulates fetching bank transactions (or integrates with a real API) and syncs new transactions to the database. An admin can manually trigger a sync from the UI.
- **User Experience:**  
  Administrators view a list of bank transactions and sync data with a simple button click.

### Budget Planning & Monitoring

- **Database:**  
  A `budgets` table stores budget data (department, allocated, actual, start and end dates). An accessor calculates variance automatically.
- **Functionality:**  
  Users can create, view, edit, and delete budgets via modals. The system updates and displays key metrics in a clean, modal-driven interface.
- **User Experience:**  
  A dashboard view displays all budgets with actionable buttons for viewing details, editing, or deleting records—all without leaving the page.

### Inventory Management

- **Database:**  
  - **Products:** Stores product details including SKU, barcode, price, cost, quantity, reorder point, and status.  
  - **Inventory Transactions:** Logs stock movements (in/out), including a `warehouse_id` for multi-warehouse support.
  - **Warehouses:** Stores warehouse details (name, location, capacity, manager).  
  - **Suppliers:** Manages supplier information.  
  - **Purchase Orders:** Records orders placed to suppliers.
- **Functionality:**  
  - **Product Management:** Add, update, and delete products.  
  - **Transaction Recording:** When stock is received or used, transactions are recorded and product quantities update automatically.
  - **Purchase Orders & Suppliers:** Manage orders and supplier details.
  - **Advanced Features:** Barcode/QR code integration, low-stock alerts, and inventory valuation reports.
- **User Experience:**  
  A robust inventory dashboard allows users to manage products, record transactions, create purchase orders, and receive alerts for low stock—all integrated into a unified system.

## Development Notes

- **Modular Structure:**  
  Each module is encapsulated in its own set of migrations, models, controllers, and views for maintainability and scalability.
- **Service-Oriented:**  
  Services like `CurrencyConversionService` and `BankIntegrationService` encapsulate external integrations and complex business logic.
- **UI/UX:**  
  The interface is built with Bootstrap 5 for responsiveness. Modals are used to provide a seamless user experience.
- **RESTful Routes:**  
  Routes are organized under prefixes (e.g., `/finance/invoices`, `/inventory`) for clarity and consistency.
- **Testing:**  
  Use `php artisan serve` and visit the various module URLs to test functionality. Unit and feature tests are recommended as the project grows.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Automated Bank Sync:**  
  Implement scheduled tasks for automatic bank transaction sync.
- **Barcode/QR Integration:**  
  Integrate with barcode scanners or mobile camera APIs for product scanning.
- **Advanced Reporting:**  
  Expand reporting features with export options, detailed analytics, and custom dashboards.
- **Multi-Warehouse & Supplier Analytics:**  
  Enhance inventory management with advanced tracking, analytics, and notifications.
- **Additional Modules:**  
  Further modules (e.g., HR, Project Management) will be developed as part of the complete business management suite.
